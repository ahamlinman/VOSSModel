                            <p>The VOSS Model is a scaled model of the solar system, located at Purdue University’s Discovery Park in West Lafayette, Indiana. The goal of the model is to carry out education, research, and outreach in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and closely related fields. The model follows a Fibonacci Spiral Path, allowing visitors to take a journey through the solar system, stopping at each planet's plaza. Each plaza has an artistic sculpture of the planet, with a plaque containing educational and inspiring information. Each plaza’s base has a representation of constellations. The model itself caters to students, with hopes to learn more about the solar system, educators, with goals to inspire their students to learn about space, and the community, with intentions to use the model as a relaxing, and visually aesthetic environment. The VOSS model is a versatile collection of art and education that will continue to inspire visitors for years.</p>

                                <img src="images/Janice_Voss.jpg" class="img-rounded" /> VOSS is dedicated to Janice Voss, a Purdue alumnus, and the inspiration she created through her work in astronomy. Becoming an astronaut in July 1991, Voss worked in Spacelab robotics, NASA research, and the Kepler spacecraft as Science Director. Logging more than 48 days in space, Voss flew on the STS-57, STS-83, and STS-99, which mapped over 47 million square miles of Earth’s land surface. Voss passed away in February of 2012 after battling cancer.
