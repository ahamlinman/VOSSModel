The four largest asteroids in the belt are called Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. These large asteroids make up about half of the mass of the entire asteroid belt. Scientists like to say that if you combined all of these rocky asteroids together, it would make a planet a bit smaller than Earth's moon.</p>

There are millions upon millions of asteroids that are commonly grouped based on their composition. Asteroids are mainly made up of materials that are left over from the creation of the inner solar system. There are three types of composition classes. C-types are made of clay and silicate rocks. S-types are made of silicate rocks and nickel-iron mixtures. M-types are made of metallic nickel-iron. The different compositions describe how far from the Sun they were formed. </p>
